# Module 1a: Coding for Biologists 

**Instructor:** Michelle Franc Ragsac (mragsac@eng.ucsd.edu)

To start doing bioinformatics work, the first thing you need to do is set up your computer with the necessary tools! While the software packages might vary across different analyses, this module will cover some of the common tools you need to have installed on your workstation.

This module is meant for students that have very little to no knowledge in programming but do have some knowledge and training in molecular biology. Additionally, this module will be both lecture-based and interactive.

## Module Learning Goals

1. Navigating with Command Line Interfaces (CLI) using a Terminal Application 
2. Package & Environment Management with `conda`
    1. Learning about the `conda` package manager 
    2. Configuring the `bioconda` channel for bioinformatics package installation 
    3. Creating, Saving, and Loading new `conda` environments
    4. Reviewing commonly-used Python packages for bioinformatics (e.g., `jupyterlab`, `numpy`, etc.)
3. Brief Introduction to Programming in Python
    1. The 5 Basic Concepts found in most programming languages 
    2. Examples on common programming tasks for bioinformatics work
        1. Printing & Manipulating Text: **Determining Fragments after a Restriction Enzyme Digest**
        2. Reading & Writing Files: **Evaluating a FASTQ File for Unique Sequence**
