# BISB Bootcamp 2021

Welcome to the course website for the Bioinformatics & Systems Biology Fall Quarter 2021 Bootcamp for incoming students to our doctoral program! 

## Course Instructors

This course is entirely taught by graduate students! There are three main instructors for the course from the Bioinformatics & Systems Biology program. The main instructors teach the majority of "learning modules", along with lectures that contain helpful graduate school knoweldge. There are also quite a few guest instructors that will also be joining the course!
