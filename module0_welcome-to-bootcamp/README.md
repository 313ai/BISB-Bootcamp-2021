# Pre-Bootcamp Checklist FAQ

The BISB Bootcamp is a **required** week-long introductory course for students entering the Bioinformatics & Systems Biology program at the University of California, San Diego. Based on feedback from previous years, it is demanding and exhausting, but we are doing our best to make this year's edition adaptable to this year's circumstances. 

New to this year's bootcamp is this handy-dandy checklist to help you adjust to the graduate student life in our program! We've organized this page by common questions people had during their first year. Each section starts with a few action items we would like you to complete before bootcamp and then finishes with a longer answer for the question.

---

## When will bootcamp take place, and where? 

### Action Items

- [ ] Clear your schedule for the week of **September 13, 2021 to September 17, 2021**
- [ ] Download **Zoom** for your computer if you don't already have it! 

### Long Answer

The BISB Bootcamp takes place the week before the start of classes. This year, we will host bootcamp over Zoom from September 13, 2021 to September 17, 2021. We'll start around 8:30 AM every day for icebreakers and workshops!

Because we'll be hosting bootcamp over Zoom, we will also be recording lectures for your future reference. You can find instructions for downloading Zoom and associating it with your UCSD account at the following link: https://blink.ucsd.edu/technology/file-sharing/zoom/index.html.

## When should I come to San Diego, and where do you suggest living? 

### Action Items

- [ ] *If you would are planning to live on-campus*, apply for student housing **ASAP** at the following link if you haven't already: https://hdh.ucsd.edu/arch/gradhousing.asp. 
- [ ] *If you would are planning to live off-campus*, we suggest moving to San Diego around early September so you have time to get used to the area! Please see the Long Answer section for possible living complexes and neighborhoods.

### Long Answer

#### If you're planning to live on-campus... 

We recommend applying to the graduate housing waitlist **immediately** because graduate housing is highly competitive. If you want to be in San Diego in time for the BISB Bootcamp, we suggest that you indicate your estimated arrival time on the survey to be a **month to a month-and-a-half earlier** than your actual arrival time to have higher priority on the housing queue.

> <u>**⚠ IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING ON-CAMPUS HOUSING ⚠**</u>
> 
> Recently, Housing, Dining, and Hospitality (HDH)—the aptly named organization in charge of housing, dining, and hospitality services at UCSD—proposed dramatic rent increases to graduate student housing. You can find an article in the student newspaper at the following link: https://ucsdguardian.org/2021/04/05/hdh-dramatically-increases-graduate-housing-costs/. The Visual Arts Department also released a public statement opposing the rent hikes (https://visarts.ucsd.edu/opposing-hdh-rent-increase.html); many other graduate departments are also against the rent hikes.
> 
> As students, we would like to be transparent about the current situation for on-campus housing. We *highly recommend* considering living in off-campus housing during this time as the costs will now be comparable. 

#### If you're planning to live off-campus... (*or you don't hear back from HDH by mid-August after submitting your application*)

If you would like to live *close to campus* for your first year, there are *lots* of housing options available. Here's a listing of some of the popular complexes in the area, ordered by proximity to the School of Medicine campus (as most labs are there!): 

* Solazzo Apartment Homes 
* Nobel Court Apartments
* Villa Vicenza 
* La Jolla International Gardens 
* La Scala Apartment Homes
* La Jolla Canyon Apartments
* Westwood Apartment Homes
* The Villas of Renaissance Apartment Homes
* La Jolla Crossroads & 360 Luxury Apartments 

While this is by no means a comprehensive list, it should give a good starting point! 

If you're looking to live *further away from campus*, there are some popular areas where you can find many students. We've listed a few of the neighborhoods below, along with their relative location to campus:

* **Still-Close-To-Campus**: University City/Golden Triangle
* **North**: Carmel Valley, Solana Beach, Del Mar
* **North-East**: Sorrento Valley, Mira Mesa
* **South-West**: La Jolla, Pacific Beach, Bird Rock, Ocean Beach 
* **South**: Clairemont & Clairemont Mesa, Mission Valley, Hillcrest, University Heights, North Park

Regardless of where you want to live off-campus, you can also find private condos and house rentals through resources such as the UCSD Off-Campus Housing Group on Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/groups/2387457222/), Facebook Marketplace for housing rentals, Zillow, and Craigslist.

## How should I prepare for the first day of bootcamp? 

### Action Items

- [ ] **If you have a Windows computer**, please make sure that Linux is available to you! While there are several ways to do this, we suggest the **Windows Subsystem for Linux**: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/.
- [ ] Install **`bash`** on your computer and learn the basics if you don't already know them! 
- [ ] Install **`miniconda`** on your computer to get the `conda` package manager.
- [ ] Sign up for **GitHub** on your computer and **star** this repository! 
- [ ] Install **`git`** on your computer and learn the basic syntax.
- [ ] Familiarize yourself with the basic syntax for the **`Python`** programming language if you don't already know it! 

### Long Answer 

Bootcamp moves pretty fast, so it's important to install some things ahead of time so that we can hit the ground running on September 13! During bootcamp, we'll have some hands-on, practical programming sessions, so please have the following things set up: 

1. **A terminal to use for the sessions**: We will learn how to navigate your computer (and a remote computer!) using `bash` in a *Command Line Interface* (CLI). If you don't know what that means, we've added some tutorials in this folder! 

2. **A package manager to set up software environments**: We'll go over how to create coding environments for more reproducible analyses using the `conda` package manager. 

3. **A way to version your code and collaborate with others**: Finally, we'll also cover how to track changes you (or your teammates) make to software using `git`! 

Please do not arrive on the first day without the appropriate software installed because it'll be easy to fall behind! We expect that you are all self-directed, enthusiastic learners, so as you address the above list of requirements, please feel free to ask us to clarify or assist, but please prioritize!

## What are research rotations, and how can I prepare for them? 

### Action Items

- [ ] Browse the list of faculty affiliated with the Bioinformatics & Systems Biology program and determine a list of professors you may be interested in working with; you can find a list of professors here: https://www.bioinformatics.ucsd.edu/faculty.
- [ ] Look over the list of faculty speakers for the BISB Bootcamp Summer Faculty Talks and decide which ones you would like to attend: https://github.com/mragsac/BISB-Bootcamp-2021/tree/main/module0_welcome-to-bootcamp/summer-PI-talk-series! 
- [ ] Browse Department websit pages on rotations:
* Rotation Guidelines: https://www.bioinformatics.ucsd.edu/node/99
* BISB Rotation Projects: https://www.bioinformatics.ucsd.edu/node/86
* BMI Rotation Projects: https://www.bioinformatics.ucsd.edu/node/89


### Longer Answer

During your first year as a graduate student, you will undertake *at least* three research rotations. These rotations are a way for students to "test the waters" in a lab that they're interested in so they can experience the research and culture—it's also a way for faculty to evaluate if you would be a good fit for their lab! The labs that you choose for research rotations will become labs that you will be eligible to join for the remainder of your doctoral studies!

We recommend that you browse our list of program faculty then contact professors you are interested in *before* bootcamp to schedule a rotation with them during the academic year (especially for Fall Quarter)! The faculty member will let you know if they would like to take on a rotation student and if they have funding to support your Ph.D. if both of you think that the lab is a good fit. While we recommend contacting professors before bootcamp, at least for your first rotation during the Fall, there will be some time to explore and set things up upon arrival. 

Because of feedback from previous years of bootcamp, we're also hosting a summer seminar series specifically designed for incoming students to help you set up your rotations! In these BISB Bootcamp Summer Faculty Talks, you'll be able to listen to one of our program's faculty members talk about their research and then ask them questions about their lab culture, possible rotation projects, and student expectations. We are also planning to record these talks if you would like to view them later, such as during the school year! 

You can find more information about this new talk series at the following link: https://github.com/mragsac/BISB-Bootcamp-2021/tree/main/module0_welcome-to-bootcamp/summer-PI-talk-series.

## How do I set up UCSD student accounts for signing up for classes, for email, etc.? 

### Action Items

- [ ] Firstly, ensure that you've submitted all pending documentation for your admissions application (e.g., Accepting your offer of admission, Submitting your transcripts from all institutions attended)
- [ ] *If you are an **out-of-state** student*, start the process to "Establish California Residency for Tuition Purposes" as detailed here: https://students.ucsd.edu/finances/fees/residence/criteria.html.
- [ ] Set up your UCSD Personal Identification (PID) account password at the following location: https://act.ucsd.edu/manage-sso/applicant.
- [ ] Activate and access your new UCSD student email account by following the steps outlined here: https://ucsdservicedesk.service-now.com/its?id=kb_article_view&sys_kb_id=81dfcdb4db6c90104cd8f06e0f96190b.
- [ ] Create a DUO account for two-factor authentication (2FA) using the instructions found here: https://blink.ucsd.edu/technology/security/services/two-step-login/index.html.
- [ ] Further instructions can be found on the BISB website here: https://bioinformatics.ucsd.edu/node/31.

### Longer Answer

After admittance to our program, please follow the "Online Admission Checklist" on your UCSD Applicant Portal. This checklist will include formally accepting your offer of admission and submitting your transcripts from all institutions attended. 

Additionally, our program will ask you to submit documentation to be considered a "California Resident for Tuition Purposes." To be considered a California resident, you need to satisfy three conditions:

1. You must be **physically present in California for more than one year (366 days) immediately before the residence determination date**. The residence determination date is the day instruction begins at the last of the University of California campuses to open for the quarter (https://students.ucsd.edu/finances/fees/residence/dates-deadlines.html). 
2. You must demonstrate that you **intend to make California your permanent home**. This *intent* is evaluated as an independent element of residence, separate from physical presence, and is demonstrated as establishing residential ties in California and relinquishing ties to your former place of residence. 
3. Finally, **students under the age of 24 must also meet the university's financial independence requirement** in addition to the 366-day physical presence and intent requirements. 

You can find more information about establishing California residency for tuition purposes at the following page: https://students.ucsd.edu/finances/fees/residence/about.html. 

Another thing to set up over the summer is UCSD account-related items. At UCSD, each student is given a Personal Identification Number (PID) in the form of `A########`. This PID will enable you to access resources such as class registration and financial tools! Your PID will be generated for you at least 72 hours after accepting admission to UCSD; in some cases, it may take up to a week to generate your PID. Once it is available, your PID will be available on your application portal (https://connect.grad.ucsd.edu/apply/). Once it is available, you should be able to set up your password for your PID at the following link: https://act.ucsd.edu/manage-sso/applicant. 

After setting up your PID, you should activate and access your new UCSD email account. Your email account is also used for other Information and Technology Services (ITS)-supported systems and services (e.g., computer labs, UCSD WiFi, UCSD VPN, and canvas). Detailed instructions on setting up your PID can be found here: https://ucsdservicedesk.service-now.com/its?id=kb_article_view&sys_kb_id=81dfcdb4db6c90104cd8f06e0f96190b. 

Email accounts use an **Active Directory (AD)** username for email services; this username usually consists of characters found in your name (and sometimes, numbers). For example, Michelle's AD username is `mragsac`! Your AD username is used for logging into any UCSD site that requires "Single Sign On" (SSO). You can find more information about AD accounts here: https://students.ucsd.edu/campus-services/technology/computers/index.html.

> Your **Personal Identification (PID)** number and **Active Directory (AD)** username are *not the same*. Additionally, you should protect your PID number like a password because it is tied to your identity at the university and can be used to hack into your student accounts! 

Finally, you will need to set up a DUO account for two-factor authentication (2FA). DUO 2FA is a security feature for all UCSD accounts that requires verification of identity when logging into UCSD-protected systems. After setting up your AD credentials, you **must** register for DUE before you can access any UCSD SSO-based site or application. You can find more information about registering for DUO at the following link: https://blink.ucsd.edu/technology/security/services/two-step-login/index.html.

## Are there any other new student orientations outside of the BISB Bootcamp that I need to attend?

### Action Items

- [ ] Attend the online orientations for all incoming graduate students held by Graduate Division and the new student convocation: https://grad.ucsd.edu/student-life/events/orientation/index.html.
- [ ] *If you are an international student*, attend orientations for incoming students held by the International Students and Programs Office (ISPO): https://ispo.ucsd.edu/advising/visa/new-students/graduate-students/index.html! 

### Longer Answer

The UCSD Graduate Division office has an online orientation program designed to support incoming graduate students at UC San Diego and facilitate a successful transition to graduate school. This course will be accessible through the UCSD Canvas website once the university sets up your UCSD account, so stay tuned for additional emails on that from them! 

*For newly admitted international graduate students*, an additional orientation is annually put on by the International Students & Programs Office (ISPO). You will receive an email from them when that orientation happens. Still, there are resources available for the 2021-2022 year for completing the immigration and VISA process for study in the United States. We've included the steps that ISPO recommends that you take below:

* **Step (1)**: Requesting Your Immigration Documentation: https://ispo.ucsd.edu/advising/visa/new-students/graduate-students/graduates-request-documents.html
* **Step (2)**: Preparing for Your Arrival to UCSD: https://ispo.ucsd.edu/advising/visa/new-students/graduate-students/graduates-before-arrival.html
* **Step (3)**: Upon Your Arrival to UCSD: https://ispo.ucsd.edu/advising/visa/new-students/graduate-students/graduates-upon-arrival.html

## Is there anything else I need to do before coming to UCSD?

### Action Items

- [ ] Be aware of UCSD's dates, deadlines, and holidays on the 2021-2022 Academic Calendar: https://blink.ucsd.edu/instructors/resources/academic/calendars/index.html.
- [ ] Look over and submit all health screenings and immunization requirements for incoming students: https://studenthealth.ucsd.edu/resources/health-requirements/index.html.
- [ ] Read about UC SHIP, the Student Health Insurance Plan, at the following link: https://shwadmin.ucsd.edu/uc-ship/index.html.
- [ ] Once you're in San Diego, remember to pick up your new UCSD Student Identification Card! You can find instructions on how to get an ID card here: https://sfs.ucsd.edu/campus-cards/your-student-id.html#Graduate-Students.
- [ ] Download the UCSD Mobile Application: https://mobile.ucsd.edu.

### Longer Answer

We know that there's a lot of dates to mark on your calendar at the moment, but there are a few more than you should note! UCSD has an academic calendar that details when the academic quarters begin when university holidays are, and when deadlines are! For the 2021-2022 academic year, you can find that information at the following link: https://blink.ucsd.edu/instructors/resources/academic/calendars/2020.html. 

Another thing you should keep on your radar is fulfilling all of UCSD's health screenings and immunization requirements. **All incoming students are required to meet the UC Immunization and Tuberculosis (TB) Screening Requirements**. You can find these requirements here: https://studenthealth.ucsd.edu/resources/health-requirements/index.html#Complete-the-Flu-Vaccine-Requir. To make things a little easier, we've included some of those requirements below:

| Requirement Name                | Date Due                                                           | Relevant Document Link            | 
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| TB Risk Screening Questionnaire | Fall Graduate Deadline: **November 1st**                           | [Tuberculosis Testing Requirement](https://studenthealth.ucsd.edu/_files/resources/health-requirements/tbassessment.pdf) |
| Immunization Requirements       | Fall Deadline: **September 20th**<br>Hold Placed: **November 1st** | [Immunization Form](https://studenthealth.ucsd.edu/_files/resources/health-requirements/immreqs.pdf) |

All students in our program are automatically enrolled in UC SHIP (Student Health Insurance Plan) each academic year! If you would like to opt-out of the UC SHIP program, you must demonstrate comparable healthcare coverage from another provider. You can find the forms for opting out of the UC SHIP program (called a "Health Insurance Fee Waiver") on the UCSD TritonLink student portal. You can find more information about UC SHIP on their website. 

Finally, once you're in San Diego, you should be able to get your first-ever UCSD student identification card! The first step in this process is to submit your ID photo through the Campus Card Office's online Photo Tool (https://sfs.ucsd.edu/campus-cards/photo-tool.html). After submitting your photo, you can obtain an ID card through an appointment with the campus card center. You can set up an appointment by submitting a case via the Services and Support Portal (https://support.ucsd.edu/students). 

Finally, we recommend that you download the UCSD mobile app! The UCSD mobile app contains quick and easy reference information for your virtual student ID card, weather in San Diego, parking availability on-campus, information for asymptomatic COVID-19 testing (free for all UCSD students!), and more!
