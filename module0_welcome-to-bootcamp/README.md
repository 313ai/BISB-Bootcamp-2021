# Pre-Bootcamp Checklist FAQ

The BISB Bootcamp is a **required** week-long introductory course for students entering the Bioinformatics & Systems Biology program at the University of California, San Diego. Based on feedback from previous years, it is demanding and exhausting, but we are doing our best to make this year's edition adaptable to this year's circumstances. 

New to this year's bootcamp is this handy-dandy checklist to help you adjust to the graduate student life in our program! We've organized this page by common questions people had during their first year. Each section starts with a few action items we would like you to complete before bootcamp and then finishes with a longer answer for the question.

---

## When will bootcamp take place, and where? 

### Action Items

- [ ] Clear your schedule for the week of ** September 13, 2021 to September 17, 2021**
- [ ] Download **Zoom** for your computer if you don't already have it! 

### Long Answer

The BISB Bootcamp takes place the week before the start of classes. This year, we will host bootcamp over Zoom from September 13, 2021 to September 17, 2021. We'll start around 8:30 AM every day for icebreakers and workshops!

Because we'll be hosting bootcamp over Zoom, we will also be recording lectures for your future reference. You can find instructions for downloading Zoom and associating it with your UCSD account at the following link: https://blink.ucsd.edu/technology/file-sharing/zoom/index.html.

## When should I come to San Diego, and where do you suggest living? 

### Action Items

- [ ] *If you would are planning to live on-campus*, apply for student housing **ASAP** at the following link if you haven't already: https://hdh.ucsd.edu/arch/gradhousing.asp. 
- [ ] *If you would are planning to live off-campus*, we suggest moving to San Diego around early September so you have time to get used to the area! Please see the Long Answer section for possible living complexes and neighborhoods.

### Long Answer

#### If you're planning to live on-campus... 

We recommend applying to the graduate housing waitlist **immediately** because graduate housing is highly competitive. If you want to be in San Diego in time for the BISB Bootcamp, we suggest that you indicate your estimated arrival time on the survey to be a **month to a month-and-a-half earlier** than your actual arrival time to have higher priority on the housing queue.

> <u>**⚠ IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING ON-CAMPUS HOUSING ⚠**</u>
> 
> Recently, Housing, Dining, and Hospitality (HDH)—the aptly named organization in charge of housing, dining, and hospitality services at UCSD—proposed dramatic rent increases to graduate student housing. You can find an article in the student newspaper at the following link: https://ucsdguardian.org/2021/04/05/hdh-dramatically-increases-graduate-housing-costs/. The Visual Arts Department also released a public statement opposing the rent hikes (https://visarts.ucsd.edu/opposing-hdh-rent-increase.html); many other graduate departments are also against the rent hikes.
> 
> As students, we would like to be transparent about the current situation for on-campus housing. We *highly recommend* considering living in off-campus housing during this time as the costs will now be comparable. 

#### If you're planning to live off-campus... (*or you don't hear back from HDH by mid-August after submitting your application*)

If you would like to live *close to campus* for your first year, there are *lots* of housing options available. Here's a listing of some of the popular complexes in the area, ordered by proximity to the School of Medicine campus (as most labs are there!): 

* Solazzo Apartment Homes 
* Nobel Court Apartments
* Villa Vicenza 
* La Jolla International Gardens 
* La Scala Apartment Homes
* La Jolla Canyon Apartments
* Westwood Apartment Homes
* The Villas of Renaissance Apartment Homes
* La Jolla Crossroads & 360 Luxury Apartments 

While this is by no means a comprehensive list, it should give a good starting point! 

If you're looking to live *further away from campus*, there are some popular areas where you can find many students. We've listed a few of the neighborhoods below, along with their relative location to campus:

* **Still-Close-To-Campus**: University City/Golden Triangle
* **North**: Carmel Valley, Solana Beach, Del Mar
* **North-East**: Sorrento Valley, Mira Mesa
* **South-West**: La Jolla, Pacific Beach, Bird Rock, Ocean Beach 
* **South**: Clairemont & Clairemont Mesa, Mission Valley, Hillcrest, University Heights, North Park

Regardless of where you want to live off-campus, you can also find private condos and house rentals through resources such as the UCSD Off-Campus Housing Group on Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/groups/2387457222/), Facebook Marketplace for housing rentals, Zillow, and Craigslist.

## How should I prepare for the first day of bootcamp? 

### Action Items

- [ ] **If you have a Windows computer**, please make sure that Linux is available to you! While there are several ways to do this, we suggest the **Windows Subsystem for Linux**: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/.
- [ ] Install **`bash`** on your computer and learn the basics if you don't already know them! 
- [ ] Install **`miniconda`** on your computer to get the `conda` package manager.
- [ ] Sign up for **GitHub** on your computer and **star** this repository! 
- [ ] Install **`git`** on your computer and learn the basic syntax.
- [ ] Familiarize yourself with the basic syntax for the **`Python`** programming language if you don't already know it! 

### Long Answer 

Bootcamp moves pretty fast, so it's important to install some things ahead of time so that we can hit the ground running on September 13! During bootcamp, we'll have some hands-on, practical programming sessions, so please have the following things set up: 

1. **A terminal to use for the sessions**: We will learn how to navigate your computer (and a remote computer!) using `bash` in a *Command Line Interface* (CLI). If you don't know what that means, we've added some tutorials in this folder! 

2. **A package manager to set up software environments**: We'll go over how to create coding environments for more reproducible analyses using the `conda` package manager. 

3. **A way to version your code and collaborate with others**: Finally, we'll also cover how to track changes you (or your teammates) make to software using `git`! 

Please do not arrive on the first day without the appropriate software installed because it'll be easy to fall behind! We expect that you are all self-directed, enthusiastic learners, so as you address the above list of requirements, please feel free to ask us to clarify or assist, but please prioritize!

## What are research rotations, and how can I prepare for them? 

### Action Items

- [ ] Browse the list of faculty affiliated with the Bioinformatics & Systems Biology program and determine a list of professors you may be interested in working with; you can find a list of professors here: https://www.bioinformatics.ucsd.edu/faculty.
- [ ] Look over the list of faculty speakers for the BISB Bootcamp Summer Faculty Talks and RSVP to professors whose talks you would like to attend! 

### Longer Answer

During your first year as a graduate student, you will undertake *at least* three research rotations. These rotations are a way for students to "test the waters" in a lab that they're interested in so they can experience the research and culture—it's also a way for faculty to evaluate if you would be a good fit for their lab! The labs that you choose for research rotations will become labs that you will be eligible to join for the remainder of your doctoral studies!

We recommend that you browse our list of program faculty then contact professors you are interested in *before* bootcamp to schedule a rotation with them during the academic year (especially for Fall Quarter)! The faculty member will let you know if they would like to take on a rotation student and if they have funding to support your Ph.D. if both of you think that the lab is a good fit. While we recommend contacting professors before bootcamp, at least for your first rotation during the Fall, there will be some time to explore and set things up upon arrival. 

Because of feedback from previous years of bootcamp, we're also hosting a summer seminar series specifically designed for incoming students to help you set up your rotations! In these BISB Bootcamp Summer Faculty Talks, you'll be able to listen to one of our program's faculty members talk about their research and then ask them questions about their lab culture, possible rotation projects, and student expectations. We are also planning to record these talks if you would like to view them later, such as during the school year!
