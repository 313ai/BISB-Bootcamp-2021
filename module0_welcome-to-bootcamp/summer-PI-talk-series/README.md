# BISB Bootcamp Summer PI Talk Series

When we've taught the BISB Bootcamp in the past, we usually allowed BISB faculty to present in 15~30 minute sessions before continuing with the rest of the Bootcamp material. This year, we decided to do a complete overhaul of Bootcamp and host a summer research seminar series featuring BISB and DBMI professors accepting rotation students! 

Even though we are catering the talks for incoming students, this event is open to all members of the BISB Program! 

## WHERE and WHEN will the talks take place? 

These talks will take place each **Thursday from 12:00 PM PST to 1:00 PM PST** over Zoom! They will start on June 24th, 2021, and continue until September 9th, 2021, before the BISB Bootcamp starts the following week. 

We plan to send out a flyer to the BISB Program mailing list before each talk to share some information on the week's presenters, along with a password-protected link to the Zoom meeting. 

## HOW will these talks be formatted? 

For each session, we plan to allow two professors to present their research in two 25-minute talks. After each professor presents, we'll move into 10 minutes of guided Q&A. For the Q&A, the moderators will be asking each professor standardized questions about their lab's student-to-postdoc ratio and research rotation expectations before opening up the floor for general research questions.
