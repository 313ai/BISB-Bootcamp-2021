# Module 3a: Programming 101 

**Instructor:** Lauryn Bruce (lbruce@ucsd.edu)

Building on the foundation laid in Module 1a: Coding for Biologists, this module aims to give an overview of common programming languages, best software practices, and resources. Using Python 3, we will also practice some of the techniques covered within a jupyter notebook to introduce some packages that are used regularly during the first year of graduate school 

This module is meant for students that have very little to no knowledge in programming but do have some knowledge and training in molecular biology. Additionally, this module will be both lecture-based and interactive.
